1. Explain the following
	1. Peek Operation: The Peek operation is commonly associated with data structures, such as stacks or queues. It allows you to view the element at the top of the stack or the front of the queue without removing it. Unlike pop or dequeue operations, the Peek operation does not modify the structure itself.
2. Discuss extensively on the memory implementations of the following data structure types
	1. Stack: 
		- **Memory Allocation:** Typically implemented using arrays or linked lists.
		- **Memory Usage:** Dynamic and adjusts as elements are pushed or popped.
		- **Access Time:** Constant time for array-based implementations.
	1. Graph :
		- **Memory Allocation:** Nodes and edges can be represented using adjacency lists or matrices.
		- **Memory Usage:** Adjacency list uses less memory for sparse graphs, while adjacency matrix is more space-efficient for dense graphs.
		- **Access Time:** Depends on the representation chosen.
	1. Queue:
		- **Memory Allocation:** Similar to stacks, queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
		- **Memory Usage:** Dynamic and adjusts as elements are enqueued or dequeued.
		- **Access Time:** Constant time for array-based implementations.
1. Explain what the following mean
	1. Complete binary tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as left as possible.
	2. String: A string is a sequence of characters or symbols, often represented as a one-dimensional array or linked list.
	3. Set: A set is a collection of distinct elements with no specific order. It is a fundamental data structure in computer science.
2. Briefly explain each of the following
	1. Heap: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is often used to implement priority queues.
	2. Hash technique: Hashing involves mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. Hash functions are used in hash tables to quickly locate a data record given its search key.
	3. Memory Management: Memory management involves the allocation and deallocation of memory to programs at runtime.
	4. Fragmentation: Fragmentation refers to the inefficiency in memory utilization due to unused or partially used memory blocks.
3. Enumerate the advantages and disadvantages of
	1. Buddy system: 
		- **Advantages:** Efficient for power-of-two-sized allocations, reduces external fragmentation.
		- **Disadvantages:** Internal fragmentation can occur, and finding an appropriate buddy can be complex.
	1. Adjacency matrix: 
		- **Advantages:** Simple representation, easy to implement for dense graphs.
		- **Disadvantages:** Inefficient for sparse graphs, consumes more space.
1. Briefly discuss each of the following
	1. Edge: In a graph, an edge represents a connection between two nodes. It may have a weight in weighted graphs.
	2. Path: - A path in a graph is a sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices.
	3. Cycle: - A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, traversing a series of edges.
