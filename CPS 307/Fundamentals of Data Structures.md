## **Definition**
- **Data:** Data is a value or set of values.
- **Entity:** An entity is any object in a system that we want to model and store information about.
- **Information:** Processed data.
- **Data Types:** Data types are classifications of the types of data that a variable or object can hold.

## **What is Data Structure?**
Data structure refers to:
- A scheme for organizing related pieces of information.
- The way in which sets of data are organized in a particular system.
- An organized aggregate of data items.
- The representation of the logical relationship existing between individual elements of data.
- How data is efficiently organized to aid ease of access and storage.

### **Data Structures Classification**

Data structures can be broadly categorized into two general classifications:

1. **Linear Data Structures**: Linear data structures are organized in a sequential and linear manner, where each element is connected to its previous and next elements, forming a one-dimensional arrangement. This structure facilitates straightforward traversal and access to the data elements.
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**: Non-linear data structures, in contrast, do not follow a linear sequence. Instead, they allow elements to be connected in a more complex, branching manner. These structures represent more intricate relationships among data elements and enable the creation of hierarchical or interconnected relationships. 
#### **Linear Data Structures**
- **Array:** A collection of a finite number of homogeneous data elements.
- **Queue:** A linear collection of data items in which insertion takes place at one end and deletion can take place at the other end (First in First Out).
- **Stack:** A linear collection of data items where insertion and deletion can occur at only one end (Last in First Out).
- **Linked List:** Data elements are managed by a collection of nodes, where each node contains a link or pointer pointing to the next node in the list. [[Types of Linked List]]

#### **Non-Linear Data Structures**
- **Tree**
- **Graph**

In linear data structures, each element has a fixed next element, whereas in non-linear data structures, each element can have many different next elements.
