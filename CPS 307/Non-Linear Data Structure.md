## Tree:
A tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure where the elements are arranged in tree-like structure. In a tree, the topmost node is called the root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. 

Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is non-linear

#### Characteristics of a tree
- In a tree, the Height of the root can be defined as the longest path from the root node to the leaf node. 
- In a tree, one can also calculate the depth from the top to any node. The root node has a depth of 0

## Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of finite set of vertices (or nodes) and edges. It is used to solve challenging and complex programming problems.

#### Characteristics of graph:
- The maximum distance from a vertex to all the other vertices is considered the eccentricity of that vertex. 
- The vertex having minimum eccentricity is considered the central point of the graph. 
- The minimum value of eccentricity from all vertices is considered the radius of a connected graph.
