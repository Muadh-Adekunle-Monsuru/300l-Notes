1. Write short note on each
	1. Abstract data type: An Abstract Data Type is a high-level description of a set of operations that can be performed on a data structure, without specifying how these operations are implemented. It defines the behavior of the data type and its operations, allowing for different implementations. Examples include stacks, queues, and lists.
	2. Descendants of a tree: In a tree data structure, the descendants of a node are all the nodes that can be reached by moving down the tree from that particular node. This includes its children, grandchildren, and all nodes in the sub-tree rooted at that node.
	3. Infix-traverse order:  In infix traversal order, nodes of a binary tree are visited in the order of left subtree, root, and then right subtree. For example, for a binary expression tree, this would correspond to visiting operands in the order they appear in the infix expression.
2. Discuss the implementation of the following data structure
	1. Record: A record is a data structure that stores related data items under one name. It consists of fields, each representing an attribute or property, and can hold various data types. Records are often used in databases and represent a single entity or a row in a table.
	2. Linked List
	3. Array
3. What are the reasons that make RECORD different from Linear Array
4. Discuss complete binary tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree where all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes are positioned as left as possible. It has an efficient array representation, making it suitable for certain algorithms and data structures like heaps.
5. Explain consisely what the following terms mean
	1. Graph
	2. Directed graph: A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph where edges have a direction. Each edge connects an ordered pair of vertices, indicating a one-way relationship.
	3. Subgraph: A subgraph is a graph formed by a subset of vertices and edges from a larger graph, preserving the same relationships.
	4. Weighted graph: A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has an associated numerical value or weight, representing a measure such as distance, cost, or time.
	5. Isolated graph: An isolated graph is a graph where each vertex is not connected to any other vertex, meaning there are no edges between the vertices. Each vertex is isolated from the others in terms of connectivity.
