## Question ONE
1) Computational Statistics involves intensive programming in solving problems thereby making inference a lot easier. Many software exists today but R has grown so much more than 5000 packages are contributed from institutions worldwide. It has therefore taken the position of a statistical lingua franca. State the advantages of using R for statistical computing.
2) In respect of (a) good programming habits are desirable. State the attributes of a good statistical programe.
3) With respect to R define the following terms:
	(i) Function (ii)Variable (iii) Constant (iv) String (v) Vector 
	(i) **Function:**
	   - **Definition:** In R, a function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are used to modularize code, making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain. R provides many built-in functions, and users can also create their own functions.
	
	(ii) **Variable:**
	   - **Definition:** A variable in R is a storage location identified by a name, used to store data values. R allows users to assign values to variables, and these values can be of various types, such as numeric, character, logical, etc. Variables are essential for storing and manipulating data within a program.
	
	(iii) **Constant:**
	   - **Definition:** In R, constants refer to fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program. Unlike variables, the value of a constant cannot be modified once it is assigned. While R doesn't have explicit constants, some values may be treated as constants in practice.
	
	(iv) **String:**
	   - **Definition:** In R, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single (' ') or double (" ") quotes. Strings are used to represent text data. Operations like concatenation, substring extraction, and manipulation can be performed on strings in R.
	
	(v) **Vector:**
	   - **Definition:** A vector in R is a one-dimensional array that can hold elements of the same data type. Vectors can be created using the `c()` function and are fundamental for data manipulation and analysis in R. They can be numeric, character, logical, etc. Vectorized operations make R well-suited for handling vectors efficiently.

**Speed in Miles/hrs**

|  |  |  |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

1) *Explain in detail the significance of an estimate at alpha-level of significance. Also explain how the significance leads to acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis ($H_0$)*
	The significance level (alpha) in hypothesis testing represents the probability of making a Type I error—rejecting a true null hypothesis. An estimate is considered significant if the p-value associated with the test statistic is less than or equal to the chosen alpha level.
	
	- **Significance at Alpha-Level:**
		
		- If p-value ≤ alpha: The result is considered statistically significant.
		- If p-value > alpha: The result is not considered statistically significant.
	- **Decision Rule:**
		
		- If p-value ≤ alpha: Reject the null hypothesis (H0).
		- If p-value > alpha: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.
	
	**Example:** Suppose alpha (α) is set at 0.05. If the p-value obtained from a hypothesis test is 0.03, which is less than 0.05, the result is considered statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level. This leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

(ii) to call the object into R console for analysis
(iii)find the mean, standard deviation, and skewness of the radiation observations.
(iv)PIot a histogram of the solar.radiation.

---
## Answer

### (a) Explanation of the R Code:

```R
# Clear the workspace
rm(list=ls())

# Get the current working directory
getwd()

# Set the working directory to "C:/Users/Sholadehindel/Desktop"
setwd(dir="C:/Users/Sholadehindel/Desktop")

# Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100
n = 1:100

# Generate a vector 'y' of values using the log-gamma function
y = lgamma(n + 1)

# Assign a value to a variable '$x'
$x = 0.5 * log(2 * pi) + (n + 0.5) * log(n) - n

# Plot the vector 'x' against 'y'
plot(x, y)

# Calculate the variance of vector 'y'
var(y)

# Calculate the square root of the variance of 'y'
sqrt(var(y))

# Quit R
q()
```

Explanation:
- `rm(list=ls())`: Clears the workspace, removing all objects.
- `getwd()`: Retrieves the current working directory.
- `setwd(dir="C:/Users/Sholadehindel/Desktop")`: Sets the working directory to the specified path.
- `n = 1:100`: Creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100.
- `y = lgamma(n + 1)`: Generates a vector 'y' using the log-gamma function.
- `$x = 0.5 * log(2 * pi) + (n + 0.5) * log(n) - n`: Incorrect syntax, should be `x = 0.5 * log(2 * pi) + (n + 0.5) * log(n) - n`.
- `plot(x, y)`: Plots the vector 'x' against 'y'.
- `var(y)`: Calculates the variance of vector 'y'.
- `sqrt(var(y))`: Calculates the square root of the variance of 'y'.
- `q()`: Quits R.

### (b) R Codes for Solar Radiation Data:

```R
# (i) Assign the data to an object called solar.radiation
solar.radiation <- c(11.1, 10.6, 6.3, 8.8, 10.7, 11.2, 8.9, 12.2)

# (ii) Call the object into R console for analysis
solar.radiation

# (iii) Find the mean, standard deviation, and skewness
mean_solar <- mean(solar.radiation)
sd_solar <- sd(solar.radiation)
skew_solar <- moments::skewness(solar.radiation)

# Display the results
cat("Mean:", mean_solar, "\n")
cat("Standard Deviation:", sd_solar, "\n")
cat("Skewness:", skew_solar, "\n")

# (iv) Plot a histogram of solar.radiation
hist(solar.radiation, main = "Solar Radiation Histogram", xlab = "Radiation")
```

Explanation:
- `(i)`: Creates an object named `solar.radiation` with the given data.
- `(ii)`: Displays the contents of `solar.radiation`.
- `(iii)`: Calculates the mean, standard deviation, and skewness of `solar.radiation`.
- `(iv)`: Plots a histogram of `solar.radiation` with a title and x-axis label.
