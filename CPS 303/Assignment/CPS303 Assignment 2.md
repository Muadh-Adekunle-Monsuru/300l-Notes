1) **3 types of decision statements and 7 types of repetitive statements**

Give syntax of each with examples


Statement | Description 
---|---
If ... Then statement | An If...Then statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements. 
If...Then...Else statement | An If...Then statement can be followed by an optional Else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false. 
nested If statements | You can use one If or Else if statement inside another If or Else if statements.
Select Case statement | A Select Case statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
nested Select Case statements | You can use one select case statement inside another select case statements. 

Certainly! Here are examples for each of the statements you mentioned:

1. **If...Then statement:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim number As Integer = 10

   If number > 0 Then
       Console.WriteLine("Number is positive.")
   End If
   ```

2. **If...Then...Else statement:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim number As Integer = -5

   If number > 0 Then
       Console.WriteLine("Number is positive.")
   Else
       Console.WriteLine("Number is not positive.")
   End If
   ```

3. **Nested If statements:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim x As Integer = 10
   Dim y As Integer = 5

   If x > 0 Then
       If y > 0 Then
           Console.WriteLine("Both x and y are positive.")
       End If
   End If
   ```

4. **Select Case statement:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim day As Integer = 3
   Dim dayName As String

   Select Case day
       Case 1
           dayName = "Sunday"
       Case 2
           dayName = "Monday"
       Case 3
           dayName = "Tuesday"
       Case Else
           dayName = "Unknown"
   End Select

   Console.WriteLine("Day: " & dayName)
   ```

5. **Nested Select Case statements:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim category As Integer = 2
   Dim score As Integer = 75
   Dim grade As String

   Select Case category
       Case 1
           Select Case score
               Case Is >= 90
                   grade = "A"
               Case Is >= 80
                   grade = "B"
               Case Else
                   grade = "C"
           End Select
       Case 2
           grade = "Pass"
       Case Else
           grade = "Fail"
   End Select

   Console.WriteLine("Grade: " & grade)
   ```

These examples demonstrate the use of If...Then, If...Then...Else, nested If statements, Select Case, and nested Select Case statements in VB.NET.


Loop Type | Description
---|---
Do Loop | It repeats the enclosed block of statements while a Boolean condition is True or until the condition becomes True. It could be terminated at any time with the Exit Do statement.
For...Next | It repeats a group of statements a specified number of times and a loop index counts the number of loop iterations as the loop executes.
For Each...Next | It repeats a group of statements for each element in a collection. This loop is used for accessing and manipulating all elements in an array or a VB.Net collection. 
While... End | While It executes a series of statements as long as a given condition is True. 
With... End With | It is not exactly a looping construct. It executes a series of statements that repeatedly refer to a single object or structure. 
Nested loops | You can use one or more loops inside any another While, For or Do loop.

1. **Do Loop:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim counter As Integer = 1

   Do
       Console.WriteLine("Counter: " & counter)
       counter += 1
   Loop While counter <= 5
   ```

2. **For...Next:**
   ```vb.net
   For i As Integer = 1 To 5
       Console.WriteLine("Iteration: " & i)
   Next
   ```

3. **For Each...Next:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim numbers() As Integer = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

   For Each num In numbers
       Console.WriteLine("Number: " & num)
   Next
   ```

4. **While...End:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim condition As Boolean = True
   Dim count As Integer = 1

   While condition
       Console.WriteLine("Count: " & count)
       count += 1
       If count > 5 Then
           condition = False
       End If
   End While
   ```

5. **With...End With:**
   ```vb.net
   Dim person As New Person()
   With person
       .Name = "Alice"
       .Age = 25
   End With

   Console.WriteLine("Person: " & person.Name & ", Age: " & person.Age)

   ' Assuming there is a Person class defined with Name and Age properties.
   ```

6. **Nested Loops:**
   ```vb.net
   For i As Integer = 1 To 3
       For j As Integer = 1 To 3
           Console.WriteLine("i: " & i & ", j: " & j)
       Next
   Next
   ```


read about modifiers

In VB.NET, modifiers are keywords that are used to modify the declaration of classes, structures, modules, variables, methods, properties, and other programming elements. Modifiers control the visibility, access level, and behavior of these elements within a program. Here are some common modifiers in VB.NET:

1. **Access Modifiers:**
   - `Public`: The element is accessible from any other code in the same assembly or project.
   - `Private`: The element is accessible only within the declaring class or module.
   - `Protected`: The element is accessible within the declaring class or module and by derived classes.
   - `Friend`: The element is accessible only within the same assembly.
   - `Protected Friend` or `Friend Protected`: The element is accessible within the same assembly or by derived classes.

2. **Shared Modifier:**
   - `Shared`: Used to create members that belong to the type itself rather than to a specific instance. For example, shared methods and shared properties.

3. **Overrides Modifier:**
   - `Overrides`: Indicates that a method overrides a method in a base class.

4. **NotInheritable and MustInherit Modifiers:**
   - `NotInheritable`: Specifies that a class cannot be inherited.
   - `MustInherit`: Specifies that a class must be inherited.

5. **ReadOnly and WriteOnly Modifiers:**
   - `ReadOnly`: Indicates that a variable or property can only be assigned a value at the time of declaration or within a constructor.
   - `WriteOnly`: Indicates that a property can only be written to, not read.

6. **Shadows Modifier:**
   - `Shadows`: Allows a derived class to provide a new implementation for a member that is already defined in a base class.

7. **Partial Modifier:**
   - `Partial`: Allows a class, structure, interface, or module to be defined in multiple files.

8. **Overloads Modifier:**
   - `Overloads`: Allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameter lists.

These modifiers provide a way to control the behavior and accessibility of elements in your VB.NET code, allowing you to design and organize your code effectively.
