1. **Characteristics of Object-Oriented Programming Languages:**
   - **Encapsulation:** is the mechanism of bundling the properties and methods of an object together and restricting access to them from outside. Encapsulation helps to protect the integrity of the object and prevent unauthorized modification or misuse.
   - **Inheritance:** Allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors of another class (base class or superclass), promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchy of classes.
   - **Polymorphism:** Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base class, and methods can be invoked on them without knowing their specific types. This promotes flexibility and extensibility.
   - **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces allow developers to create models that represent real-world entities, hiding unnecessary details while exposing essential characteristics.

2. **VB.NET as an Object-Oriented Language:**
   - VB.NET (Visual Basic .NET) is an object-oriented programming language because it supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - It allows the creation of classes and objects, promoting the encapsulation of data and methods into a single unit.
   - Inheritance is supported, enabling the creation of new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes.
   - Polymorphism is facilitated through interfaces and inheritance, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their base classes.

3. **Components and Services of Common Language Runtime (CLR):**
   - **Garbage Collector:** Manages memory by automatically deallocating objects that are no longer in use.
   - **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler:** Converts Intermediate Language (IL) code into native machine code during runtime for execution.
   - **Common Type System (CTS):** Defines data types and operations supported by the runtime.
   - **Common Language Specification (CLS):** Defines a set of rules that language compilers must adhere to for interoperability.

4. **Effect of Try...Catch in VB.NET:**
   - The `Try...Catch` block in VB.NET is used for exception handling.
   - If an exception occurs within the `Try` block, the control is transferred to the `Catch` block where the exception can be handled.
   - This prevents the application from crashing and allows developers to implement error-handling logic.
   - Example:
     ```vb.net
     Try
         ' Code that might cause an exception
     Catch ex As Exception
         ' Handle the exception here
     End Try
     ```

5. **Backward Compatibility of VB.NET with VB6:**
   - VB.NET is not fully backward compatible with VB6. They have significant differences in syntax and features.
   - VB.NET introduced a more robust, object-oriented approach compared to the procedural style of VB6.
   - Upgrading from VB6 to VB.NET often requires modification of code due to differences in data types, exception handling, and other language features.

6. **Steps in Creating, Compiling, and Executing a Program Application in Visual Studio:**
   - **Creating a Program:**
     1. Open Visual Studio.
     2. Choose the programming language (e.g., VB.NET).
     3. Create a new project.
     4. Write code in the editor.

   - **Compiling:**
     1. Click on the "Build" menu.
     2. Select "Build Solution" to compile the code.
     3. Check the Output window for any compilation errors.

   - **Executing:**
     1. Click on the "Start Debugging" button (or press F5) to run the application.
     2. Alternatively, use "Start Without Debugging" (Ctrl + F5) to run the compiled application without debugging.

7. **VB.NET Program to Compare Strings:**
   ```vb.net
   Module Module1
       Sub Main()
           Dim str1 As String = "Hello"
           Dim str2 As String = "World"

           If String.Compare(str1, str2) = 0 Then
               Console.WriteLine("The strings are equal.")
           Else
               Console.WriteLine("The strings are not equal.")
           End If

           Console.ReadLine()
       End Sub
   End Module
   ```

8. **List of Controls in Visual Studio:**
   - **Button:** Triggers an action when clicked.
   - **TextBox:** Allows user input for text.
   - **Label:** Displays non-editable text.
   - **CheckBox:** Represents a checkbox for binary choices.
   - **RadioButton:** Represents a radio button for mutually exclusive choices.
   - **ComboBox:** Provides a dropdown list of items.
   - **ListBox:** Displays a list of items.
   - **DataGridView:** Displays data in a tabular form.
   - **ProgressBar:** Shows the progress of an operation.
   - Tooltip:
   - Timer
   - PictureBox: Displays an image
   - MonthCalendar: Display month calendar which user can select data
   - CheckedListBox:Displays a list of items with a check box on the left side of each item
1. **Prefixes and Functions for Controls:**

| Control    | Prefix    | Functions                              |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| TextBox    | txt       | Input and display of text.             |
| Label      | lbl       | Displaying non-editable text.          |
| Button     | btn       | Triggering an action when clicked.     |
| CheckBox   | chk       | Representing binary choices.           |


10. **Difference between Do While...Loop and Do...Loop While:**
    - **Do While...Loop:**
      - The condition is evaluated at the beginning.
      - The loop executes as long as the condition is true.
      - Example:
        ```vb.net
        Do While x < 10
            ' Code to be executed
            x += 1
        Loop
        ```

    - **Do...Loop While:**
      - The condition is evaluated at the end.
      is true, the loop executes at least once.
      - Example:
        ```vb.net
        Do
            ' Code to be executed
            x += 1
        Loop While x < 10
        ```
 11. Write a VB.Net program that counts even integers from 1 to 100, using any repetition statement and counter variable x. Assume the variable x has been declared but not initialized. Print only five integers per line. (Hint: use the calculation x mod 5. When the value of this is 0, print a carriage return; otherwise, print a tab character. Call Console.WriteLine to output the carriage return and call Console.Write(vbTab) to output the tab character]
```vb
Module Program
Sub Main(args As String())
	Dim x as Integer
	Do While (x<=100)
	Console.Write(x)
	If(x Mod 5 > 0) Then 
		Console.Write(vbTab)
	Else
		Console.WriteLine()
	End If
	x+=2
	Loop
End Sub
End Module
```
