In memory management, logical and physical addresses are essential concepts that help organize and access data within a computer's memory.

1. **Logical Address:**
   - *Definition:* Logical addresses, also known as virtual addresses, are the addresses generated by the CPU during a program's execution. It is unique for each running process. 
	   It is visible only to the program being executed. 
   - *Role:* These addresses provide a way for programs to access memory locations without needing to know the physical location of the data. Logical addresses form the program's view of the memory.

2. **Physical Address:**
   - *Definition:* Physical addresses represent the actual location of data in the computer's physical memory (RAM).
   - *Role:* Physical addresses are used by the memory management unit (MMU) to translate logical addresses into the corresponding physical addresses. This translation allows the CPU to interact with the actual hardware memory.

   - The translation from logical to physical addresses is typically done through a mechanism known as memory mapping.
   - Operating systems and MMUs work together to ensure that a program's logical addresses get mapped to the correct physical addresses.

**Advantages of Logical and Physical Address Separation:**
   - **Security:** Logical addresses provide a level of abstraction that enhances system security by restricting direct access to physical memory.
   - **Flexibility:** Logical addressing allows the operating system to use different memory management techniques, such as paging or segmentation, without affecting the program's view.

In summary, logical addresses are generated by the CPU and represent the program's perspective on memory, while physical addresses correspond to the actual locations in the computer's physical memory. The separation between logical and physical addressing provides flexibility, security, and efficient memory management in modern computer systems.

Contiguous memory allocation systems 
Fixed-sized partition (static partitioning): The system is divided into multiple fixed sized partitions. Each partition consists of exactly one process. It limits the amount of multiprogramming that can occur. Leads to Internal fragmentation 

Variable-sized partitions( dynamic partitioning): Partitions is being done dynamically, the size of each partition is not declared initially. The size of the partition fits only the size of the process. 
- Flexible
- Reduces wastage
- Reduces internal fragmentation

Disadvantage;
- Risk of external fragmentation
- Complex to execute
- Requires additional overhead of maintaining the memory table


Memory table keeps track of the status of each partitions. Whether it is free or allocated.
