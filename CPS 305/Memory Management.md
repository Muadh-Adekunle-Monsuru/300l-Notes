**Segmentation**
Segmentation is a memory management technique where the physical memory is divided into variable sized parts called segments. Segments can be resized dynamically. When a process is loaded, it is allocated memory in different segments - code segment, data segment, stack segment, etc. Segmentation has some benefits like no external fragmentation, but also drawbacks like limits on max segment sizes.

**Paging** 
In paging, the physical memory is divided into fixed sized blocks called frames or pages. When a process executes, its memory is also divided into pages of the same size. When a process needs to access a page that is not in physical memory, a page fault occurs and the required page is loaded from disk. This allows more processes to be loaded into physical memory through swapping. However, it can cause high latency if there are many page faults.

**Swapping**
Swapping refers to temporarily copying all the pages belonging to a process from physical memory to disk. This is done when the process is not actively executing to free up physical memory for other processes. When the process needs to execute again, its pages are copied back to physical memory from disk. The advantage of swapping is that it allows more processes to be loaded than can fit in physical memory. The disadvantage is high latency when a swapped out process needs its pages copied back to memory.

In summary - segmentation allocates variable sized memory chunks, paging uses fixed sized pages and page faults, and swapping temporarily moves entire processes to disk. Using combinations of these mechanisms, operating systems are able to effectively manage memory amongst multiple processes. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

Memory management is one of the fundamental tasks of an operating system (OS). It involves managing the allocation and deallocation of memory to different processes and ensuring that each process has enough memory to run. Memory management also aims to optimize the use of memory and reduce the overhead of memory operations.

One of the techniques that OS uses to manage memory is segmentation. Segmentation divides the memory into logical segments, each corresponding to a different part of a process, such as code, data, stack, etc. Segmentation allows the OS to isolate and protect different segments from each other and to assign different access rights to each segment. Segmentation also enables the OS to relocate segments in physical memory without changing their logical addresses.

Another technique that OS uses to manage memory is paging. Paging divides the memory into fixed-size units called pages, which are mapped to variable-size units called frames in physical memory. Paging allows the OS to allocate memory to processes in non-contiguous frames and to swap out pages that are not currently needed to disk. Paging also enables the OS to implement virtual memory, which is a technique that allows processes to use more memory than physically available by using disk space as an extension of memory.

Swapping is a technique that OS uses to free up memory when it is scarce. Swapping involves moving an entire process or a part of it from memory to disk and bringing it back when needed. Swapping allows the OS to run more processes than can fit in memory at the same time, but it also incurs a significant performance cost due to the high latency of disk operations.

Memory management is a complex and challenging topic that requires a deep understanding of how OS works and how it interacts with hardware.
