### Question 1
1. Demonstrate your understanding of what is meant by a Database
	A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of that data. It is designed to provide a systematic and centralized approach to data management.
2. What is a DBMS? Give 3 examples of DBMS
	A DBMS is software that facilitates the creation, organization, retrieval, and management of databases. It provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the database. Examples of DBMS include:
	   - Oracle
	   - Microsoft SQL Server
	   - MySQL
1. Explain the five primary functions of a database,
	- **Data Storage:** The database stores large amounts of data in a structured manner.
	- **Data Retrieval:** Allows users to retrieve specific data based on queries.
	- **Data Manipulation:** Permits users to insert, update, and delete data.
	- **Data Security:** Ensures authorized access and protects against unauthorized access.
	- **Data Integrity:** Maintains the accuracy and consistency of data.
1. List the advantages and disadvantages offered by such Systems as compared to traditional file processing systems? Explain.
	- **Advantages:**
	     - Data Integrity: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
	     - Data Security: Provides controlled access to data.
	     - Data Independence: Changes in data structure do not affect applications.
	   - **Disadvantages:**
	     - Complexity: Requires skilled personnel for design and maintenance.
	     - Cost: Initial setup and maintenance can be expensive.
	     - Overhead: Consumes system resources.

### Question 2
1. A fact that cannot be denied is that Data (Information) is the backbone and most critical resource of any organization. In these days, there is no lack of data, but there is lack of quality information. Describe in details the major key attributes of quality information.
	- Accuracy
	- Completeness
	- Consistency
	- Relevance
	- Timeliness

1. From database perspective. how do we ensure that the data supporting the most critical business processes and decisions is of the highest quality?
	- Use validation rules and constraints.
	- Regularly audit and clean data.
	- Implement data governance policies.
1. What specific benefits an organization gain from doing this
	 **Benefits of Ensuring Data Quality:**
	   - Informed Decision-Making
	   - Enhanced Operational Efficiency
	   - Improved Customer Satisfaction
	   - Compliance with Regulations
### Question 3
1. Draw clearly the Architecture of a Database System, showing the major components of the Database Systems, and explain fully the functions of four of the components and how they inter-relate?
	![[Pasted image 20231212094514.png | 350]]
	-  **File manager** manages allocation of disk space and data structures used to represent information on disk.
	- **Database manager:** The interface between low-level data and application programs and queries.
	- **Query processor:** translates statements in a query language into low-level instructions the database manager understands. (May also attempt to find an equivalent but more efficient form.) 
	- **DML precompiler:** converts DML statements embedded in an application program to normal procedure calls in a host language. The precompiler interacts with the query processor. 
	- **DDL compiler** converts DDL statements to a set of tables containing metadata stored in a data dictionary.  In addition, several data structures are required for physical system implementation: 
	- **Data files**: store the data in the database. 
	- **Data dictionary**: stores information about the structure of the database. It is used heavily. Great emphasis should be placed on developing a good design and efficient implementation of the dictionary.

2.  Differentiate between the following:
	**1. Field vs. Record:**
	
	- **Field:** An individual data item representing a single attribute of an entity (e.g., Patient Name).
	- **Record:** A collection of related fields that describes a single instance of an entity (e.g., a record for a specific patient with their name, address, and phone number).
	
	**2. Hierarchical Model vs. Network Model:**
	
	- **Hierarchical Model:** Data is organized in a tree-like structure, with one parent record having multiple child records (e.g., a department containing employees). Each child has only one parent, and navigation is limited to parent-child relationships.
	- **Network Model:** Data is organized in a graph-like structure, where records can have multiple parents and children (e.g., a student enrolled in multiple courses). This allows for more flexible relationships than the hierarchical model.
	
	**3. Relational Model vs. Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model):**
	
	- **Relational Model:** Data is stored in tables with rows (records) and columns (fields). Relationships between tables are established through foreign keys referencing primary keys.
	- **ER Model:** A conceptual model that represents entities, their attributes, and relationships between them, used for database design. It is not directly implemented in the database but guides the creation of a relational database schema.
	
	**4. Primary Key vs. Foreign Key:**
	
	- **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record within a table, ensuring no duplicates (e.g., Patient ID).
	- **Foreign Key:** A column in one table that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between them (e.g., Order ID referencing Product ID).
	
	**5. Super key vs. Candidate Key:**
	
	- **Super key:** A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record within a table. Any super key can become a candidate key.
	- **Candidate Key:** A minimal super key (no redundant attributes) that uniquely identifies a record within a table. A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is chosen as the primary key.
	
### Question 4
1. What is a database Model
	A database model serves as the blueprint for a database, defining its logical structure and organization. It dictates how data elements are stored, related, manipulated, and queried. Selecting the appropriate model is crucial for ensuring data integrity, efficiency, and flexibility. Here are the key attributes of a database model:
	
	- **Entities:** Represent real-world objects, concepts, or events (e.g., `Customers`, `Orders`, `Products`).
	- **Attributes:** Data characteristics describing each entity (e.g., `CustomerName`, `OrderDate`, `ProductName`).
	- **Relationships:** Connections between entities (e.g., a `Customer` places an `Order` for `Products`).
	- **Constraints:** Rules governing data values and relationships (e.g., `CustomerID` must be unique, `Quantity` must be a positive integer).
	 
1. Describe in details using diagrammatic illustrations with relevant examples the following Database Models
	1. **Hierarchical Model**
		- Structure: Tree-like organization, with a single parent node having child nodes (e.g., folders and subfolders).
		- Example: File system directories (C:\Documents\My Music\Rock\Queen).
		- Advantages: Well-suited for simple hierarchical data.
		- Disadvantages: Rigid structure, inefficient for complex relationships, difficult to add new data levels.
		```
		C:\
		├── Documents
		│   ├── My Music
		│   │   └── Rock
		│   │       └── Queen
		│   └── My Pictures
		└── Projects
		    ├── Code
		    └── Presentations
		```

	1. **Relationship Model**
		- Structure: Tables linked by relationships (e.g., columns in one table referencing another).
		- Example: E-commerce store with `Customers`, `Orders`, and `Products` tables.
		- Advantages: Flexible, widely used, efficient for querying and managing complex data.
		- Disadvantages: Can lead to data redundancy and joins for complex relationships.
		Diagram:
		```
		Customers (CustomerID, CustomerName, Address)
		Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate)
		Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price)
		```
	1. **Entity-relationship model**
		- Visual representation of relationships between entities:
		    
		    - Rectangles: Entities.
		    - Diamonds: Relationships.
		    - Lines: Cardinalities (1:1, 1:M, M:M).
		    
		- Example: University ER model showing `Students`, `Courses`, and `Enrollments`.
		- Advantages: Easier to understand and translate into databases.
		- Disadvantages: Less detailed than formal models.
		Diagram:
		```
		Student (StudentID, Name, Major) ---- (Enrolls) ----- Course (CourseID, Title, Department)
		```

1. Explain what each of the following relationships mean with respect to Database models using concrete examples to illustrate your  answer. 
	1. One to One (1:1) Relationship
		- Each entity in one set is associated with a single entity in the other set.
		- Example: `Passport` to `Person` (a person can have only one passport, and a passport belongs to only one person).
	1. One to Many (1:M) Relationship
		- An entity in one set is associated with multiple entities in the other set.
		- Example: `Customer` to `Order` (a customer can have many orders, but an order belongs to only one customer).
	2. Many to Many (M:M) Relationship
		- Entities in both sets can be associated with multiple entities in the other set.
		- Example: `Student` to `Course` (a student can take many courses, and a course can be taken by many students).
