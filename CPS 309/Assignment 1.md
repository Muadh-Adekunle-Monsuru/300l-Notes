**Identify 3 named data-bound environments and discuss the way database systems are used in those named environments**

Data-bound environments are those that rely on databases to store, process and retrieve large amounts of data. 

**Banks,** like Sterling Bank, use database systems to manage customer accounts, transactions, loans, credit cards and other financial services. Database systems help banks ensure data security, accuracy, consistency and availability. Database systems also enable banks to perform complex queries and analysis on their data, such as fraud detection, risk assessment and customer segmentation.

**Universities,** like Fountain University,  use database systems to store and manage information about students, faculty, courses, grades, research projects and alumni. Database systems help universities facilitate academic operations, such as enrollment, registration, scheduling, evaluation and graduation. Database systems also support universities in conducting research, publishing papers, collaborating with other institutions and maintaining academic records.

**E-commerce** platforms, like Jumia,  use database systems to handle online transactions, product catalogs, customer reviews, inventory management and shipping. Database systems help e-commerce platforms provide a fast, reliable and personalized shopping experience for their customers. Database systems also help e-commerce platforms optimize their business strategies, such as pricing, marketing, recommendation and customer service.
