1. **Requirement Engineering:** Establish the database goal by finding out exactly what goals the database is meant for. If the system is already existing, one just has to observe the manual process. 
2. Compile the necessary date by interacting with the real  stakeholders of the system. 
3. Select a database model, i.e relational, entity relational, network model. 
4. Design a schema
5. Select a suitable DBMS, MYSQL, Oracle, MongoDB. Things to consider when designing: Volume, Velocity, Veracity 
6. Setting up the infrastructure. Deploy the necessary hardware and software and networking components. 
7. Implementing the database schema using SQL: Structured Query Language.

</mark>
```SQL
INSERT INTO pet VALUES ('Fluffy','Harold','cat','f', '1999-02-04',NULL);
```
8. Implement a suitable security measure. 
	1. Role based access control
	2. Sensitive data environment
9. Testing the database: 
	1. is the database functional
	2. are the data correct
	3. Verification and Validation
 10. Performance Optimization
	 1. If the volume of data increase is there a degradation in the performance of the system. 
  11. Deployment & Maintenance: Handing over the system to the users.
