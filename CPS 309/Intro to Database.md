**What is a database:**
An integrated large volume of data stored in a computer system, in such away to facilitate access, retrieval and maintenance (update, deletion). 

**DBMS:** A suite of software for creating, storing, accessing, and maintaining efficient database system. 
E.g Ms Access, Ms-SQL, MySQL,Oracle

**Difference between a DB system and a DBMS**
a DBMS is the software responsible for managing the data within a database, while a DB System includes the DBMS as well as the hardware and infrastructure that supports the database.

A DB is an interconnected system that makes it possible

**What is a database:**
It is a single collection of structured data stored with minimum duplication so as to provide a consistent and controlled pool data. This data is common to all the users of the system but is independent of programs that use the data. In other words, a database system can be defined as an integrated collection or set of data which is structured in such a way to facilitate storage, access , retrieval  and maintenance (creation, updating, deletion). Usually databases are designed to manage very large volume of data, a DB system and a DBMS are used interchangeably. 

A DBMS is a collection of programs that are used to control the activities required to store, access, retrieve, maintain and manage data in a database. Most DB systems available today can manage not only multiple data columns rows and tables within a database but multiple databases as well.
It is a suite of software that provide an efficient, reliable, as well as common environment for accessing and maintaining data in a database. 
DBMS has a major advantage of managing large pool of data for multiple applications very efficiently and allowing it to remain permanent with guaranteed accuracy and safety. 

Advantages of DB Systems:
- Persistent storage of data
- Capability of storing large volume of data, which can exist independent of any process that is used to store the data
- Provides elegant flexibility in terms of the data structure, which support efficient access to a very large set of data
- Scalability: mean DBMS is able to grow and expand as the data increases across many machines. 
- Better developer productivity, you do not need to think about structuring your data in the program.
- Shared data capability: Allows data to be shared among different individual. 
- Data is safer 

Disadvantage of DB:
- Can be complex, difficult and time consuming to design
- Confidentiality issues
- Cost; Acquiring hardware and software. Cost of training
-
