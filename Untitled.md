Hampshire County is about to hold is a large indoor and outdoor agricultural show that takes place
Organisers need to register exhibitors as they apply.
For this reason, they have decided to provide a solution:
Offer an app that will run on mobile devices, which will allow users to search for key items and
services such as “food stalls”, “horse show”, or “funfair”. The app will then use GPS and help them
find their way to the food stall that was selected or a horse show at a particular time. 
The organisers also realise that not everyone who comes to the show will have, or want to carry a
tablet all day, and not every visitor will have a smartphone, so they are installing kiosk-type
computers around the buildings and grounds. At the entrance of each building or
marquee (large tent), there will be a reception where staff can provide information about the
exhibitors located in that particular area, exhibitor and any other type of
question visitors might have. For staff to be able to do so, the receptions need to be equipped with
computer devices, either fixed or portable. On the other hand, the exhibitors' stands require the
presence of computer devices where they will be able to display videos and images through
projectors, showcase their products, communicate with their company's headquarters through
the Internet when needed or store customer-related information. Finally, the majority of the
exhibitors tend to equip their stand staff with small portable devices. This way, staff can wonder
around the stand talking to visitors, asking them to fill in their contact details or even filling in
some short questionnaires.
