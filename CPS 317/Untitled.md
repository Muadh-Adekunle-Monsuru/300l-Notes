1. Write the r function name of the following statistical distribution
	1. Poisson
	2. Uniform
	3. Beta Distribution
	4. Normal Distribution
	5. Weibull Distribution
	6. Gamma Distribution
	7. Geometric Distribution
	8. Hypergeometric distribution
	9. Lognormal Distribution
	
2. Consider the set of data 0,1,1,2,3,4,5,8,13,21,34. Write a simple r code to compute the mean, median, standard deviation and variance. Furthermore in the same code generate another variable from the set of data , by incrementing each data point by 1 and then taking logarithm of the point. For the new data set compute the correlation and covariance of the two data sets. 
3. Using the following scores obtained from a test 26, 20, 22, 19,22,15,21,20,25,26,17,24,16,23,29. Write a single R code compute the following, summary statics, quartiles q1,q2,q3,q4. (z or t) standard score. test that the mean score is different from 0. test that the mean score is different from the mean of the data. Test that the mean score is the same as the mean of the data. Test that the score is normal -3 and +3 .
