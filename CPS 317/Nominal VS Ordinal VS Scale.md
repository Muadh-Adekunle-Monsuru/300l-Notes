1. **Nominal:**
   - Nominal variables are categorical in nature.
   - Categories have no inherent order or ranking.
   - Examples include gender, ethnicity, or country of residence.
   - In SPSS, you would select "Nominal" for variables that fall into this category.

2. **Ordinal:**
   - Ordinal variables represent ordered categories or ranks.
   - The intervals between categories are not necessarily equal.
   - Examples include education levels (e.g., high school, college, graduate).
   - In SPSS, you would select "Ordinal" for variables that have ordered categories.

3. **Scale (Interval/Ratio):**
   - Scale variables have equal intervals between values and a true zero point.
   - Examples include temperature in degrees Celsius, income in dollars.
   - "Interval" and "Ratio" are often used interchangeably for this type of measurement.
   - In SPSS, you would select "Scale" for variables that have numerical values with meaningful intervals.
