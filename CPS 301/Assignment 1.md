Structured programming is a programming paradigm that aims to improve the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by enforcing structured control flow constructs, such as selection (if/the n/else), repetition (while and for), and sequence .  

Structured programming discourages the use of unconditional jumps, such as the GOTO statement, which can make code difficult to read and understand. Instead, it encourages the use of control flow constructs such as IF, ELSE, WHILE, and DO-WHILE loops.

Structured programming was developed in the 1960s and 1970s as a response to the problems associated with unstructured programming, such as spaghetti code. Spaghetti code is difficult to read, understand, and modify, and it can be very prone to errors.

The rationale behind structured programming is to make programs more readable, reliable, and maintainable by imposing a clear and consistent structure on the code. Structured programming also facilitates debugging, testing, and verification by reducing the number of possible paths and states in a program.

Structured programming is also more efficient than unstructured programming. This is because compilers can generate more efficient code for structured programs.

The Structured Programming Theorem, proposed by Edsger W. Dijkstra, asserts that any program can be written using only three basic control structures: sequence, selection, and iteration. This theorem underlines the idea that complex programs can be systematically broken down into simpler, structured components, improving software quality and maintainability.
