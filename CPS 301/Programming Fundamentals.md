##### What does computer programming mean?
A program is a set of instructions written and compiled in a specific programming language given to a computer to perform a specified task. While programming is the art and science of creating computer programs. [Writing, Compiling, Testing, Debugging, Maintaining of Source Code]

##### Tools Needed in Programming
- Text Editor
- JDK SDK

Steps to develop a program
- Analyze: Understanding the problem to be solved. Trying to understand the input and output data. Looking for the best solution
- Design: Designing an algorithm
- Test: After designing the algorithm, test for correctness  and executing the program
- Implementation: Translate the algorithm to a suitable programming language
- Compile and execute the program
- Documentation: how users must use the software, the functions of the system. 
	1. Writing comments (internal documentation)
	2. External documentation: Guides and details of how to use the program.
