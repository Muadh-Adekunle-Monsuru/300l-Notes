### What Does Computer Programming Mean?

A program is a set of instructions written and compiled in a specific programming language given to a computer to perform a specified task. Programming is the art and science of creating computer programs, involving activities such as writing, compiling, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code.

**Tools Needed in Programming:**
- Text Editor
- JDK SDK

**Steps to Develop a Program:**
1. **Analyze:**
   - Understand the problem to be solved.
   - Comprehend input and output data.
   - Look for the best solution.

2. **Design:**
   - Create an algorithm.

3. **Test:**
   - After designing the algorithm, test for correctness and execute the program.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Translate the algorithm to a suitable programming language.

5. **Compile and Execute:**
   - Compile and execute the program.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Provide instructions on how users should use the software.
     - Writing comments (internal documentation).
     - External documentation: Guides and details on how to use the program.

### Classification of Programming Languages (11/10/23)

**High-level Languages:**
- Widely used today due to their ease of use.
- Not executable; instead, their source program is read as input by the compiler.

**Low-level Languages:** (Include specific details about low-level languages if available, as the note currently ends abruptly.)
