<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> "What is structured programming"</mark>


Breaks a program into different logical sections called modules, in such a way to minimize the complexity of the programs. It is also called modular programming. It's essence is to reduce the complexity of the program.

It makes debugging a program easier, as the lines of code is shortened.

## Characteristic of Structured Program Modules
- A structured program module must have a label or a name.
- Each program module must perform only one specific task.
- It must be able to complete that task before continuing.
- The program should have one entry point and exit point  (Pipeline Structure)
- Must be independent, from other modules. 

## Ways of Designing Computer Program (Assignment)
- Top-down Approach
- Bottom-up Approach 

## Criteria of Judging a Computer Program
- **Solvability:** Does it solve the problem efficiently 
- **Workability:** Ability to accommodate and handle errors. So that the program works under any and all conditions. 
- **Sufficient Information:** Is the program well documented, both internally and externally. 
- Logically Written: Is the program broken down into small modules each module handling a different logic. 


## Paradigms of Structured Programming
- POP: Procedural/Process Oriented Programming
- OOP: Object Oriented Programming


POP basically consists of writing a list of instructions for the computer to follow and organizing those instructions into groups (i.e functions). In POP the problem is always considered as a sequence of task to be done and a number of functions are written to accomplish that task.

 The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">emphasis lies on writing instructions</mark> to complete the task little attention is given to the data. 
Examples  of POP:
COBOL, FORTRAN, C

### Characteristics of POP
- Function oriented
- Most functions share a global data
- Data moves openly 
- Functions transform data from one form to another.

Object Oriented Programming:
Is an approach that provides a way of modularizing programs by creating portioned memory area for both data and methods that can be used as templates for creating copies of such module on demand.
In other words an object is considered to be a partition area of the memory that stores data and a set of operations that can access that data.

Emphasis is on data, program are divided into. Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects. 
Methods that operate on the data are tied together to the object. Objects can communicate with each other through methods. OOP allows reusability.
