*Definition of Structured Programming:*
Structured programming, also known as modular programming, involves breaking a program into distinct logical sections called modules. The primary objective is to minimize overall complexity and enhance code clarity. This approach makes debugging easier by shortening the lines of code.

*Characteristics of Structured Program Modules:*
- A structured program module must have a label or a name.
- Each program module must perform only one specific task.
- It must be able to complete that task before continuing.
- The program should have one entry point and exit point (Pipeline Structure).
- Modules must be independent of other modules.

*Ways of Designing Computer Program (Assignment):*
- Top-down Approach
- Bottom-up Approach

*Criteria of Judging a Computer Program:*
- **Solvability:** Efficient problem-solving.
- **Workability:** Ability to handle errors under any conditions.
- **Sufficient Information:** Well-documented program, both internally and externally.
- **Logically Written:** Program broken down into small modules, each handling different logic.

**Paradigms of Structured Programming**

Structured programming is categorized into two main paradigms:
1. *Procedural Oriented Programming (POP):*
   - In POP, the emphasis is on writing instructions to complete tasks.
   - Examples of POP languages include COBOL, FORTRAN, and C.

   *Characteristics of POP:*
   - Function-oriented.
   - Most functions share global data.
   - Data moves openly.
   - Functions transform data from one form to another.

2. *Object Oriented Programming (OOP):*
   - OOP modularizes programs by creating memory areas for both data and methods.
   - An object is a memory area storing data and operations to access that data.
   - OOP promotes reusability.

   *Key Concepts of OOP:*
   - **Class:** A template for an object.
   - **Object:** An instance of a class.
   - **Variables:** Variables within a class are instance variables.
   - Classes can have relationships with other classes.

   *Benefits of OOP:*
   - **Modularity:** Source code for an object can be written and maintained independently.
   - **Information Hiding:** Internal details are hidden, interaction through methods.
   - **Code Reuse:** Existing objects can be utilized.
   - **Ease of Debugging & Pluggability:** Problematic objects can be replaced, facilitating debugging and modification.

*Types of Classes in Java:*
- User-defined
- Pre-defined
- Executable: A class that always gives results.
- Non-executable
