Describe the two approaches to software development and give appropriate examples:
- Top-down Approach
- Bottom-up Approach

What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of each approach

Does Procedural Programming and OOP implement the top down or bottom up approach to software development 

---

**Top-down Approach:**

This approach starts with a broad overview of the system and gradually refines it into smaller, more detailed components. It begins with the main module and then breaks it down into sub-modules. An example is the Waterfall model, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

*Advantages:*
- Clear understanding of system architecture from the beginning.
- Easier to manage and prioritize tasks.
- Early identification of high-level issues.

*Disadvantages:*
- Limited flexibility for changes during development.
- Delayed tangible results until the entire system is complete.
- Might not suit projects with evolving requirements.

**Bottom-up Approach:**

This method starts with individual components, gradually combining them into larger subsystems and ultimately into a complete system. Examples include Agile and incremental development, where functionalities are added in iterations.

*Advantages:*
- Early and continuous delivery of functional parts.
- Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.
- Easier to test and debug smaller components.

*Disadvantages:*
- Integration challenges as components are developed independently.
- May lack an overall system view until later stages.
- Initial lack of a clear, defined architecture.

In practice, a combination of both approaches, known as the Incremental Model, is often used to leverage the benefits of both top-down and bottom-up development.

**Procedural Programming:**

Procedural programming typically aligns more with the top-down approach. In procedural languages like C, the program is structured as a series of procedures or functions, with a clear entry point (main function) that calls other functions. The program starts with a main routine and then calls modularized subroutines to perform specific tasks. This reflects a hierarchical, step-by-step design similar to the top-down approach.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

OOP can be seen as aligning with the bottom-up approach. In OOP, a system is built by creating and combining objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Each object represents a self-contained unit with its own properties and methods. The design often starts with defining classes and objects at a lower level, and these are later combined to form more complex structures. The focus is on building from smaller, reusable components (objects) to create a complete system, resembling a bottom-up development strategy.

It's worth noting that these are general tendencies, and in real-world scenarios, both approaches can be employed in different stages of development, depending on the methodology and specific requirements.
