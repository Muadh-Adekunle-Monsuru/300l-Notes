1. Explain the three fundamentals of development methodologies
	Development methodologies are frameworks that guide the process of software development. The three fundamentals of development methodologies are:
	a. **Process:** This involves the specific set of activities, actions, and tasks that are performed during the development process. It defines the order in which these activities are carried out.
	b. **People:** The individuals involved in the development process, including analysts, developers, testers, and stakeholders. Effective communication and collaboration among team members are crucial.
	c. **Technology:** The tools, techniques, and resources used in the development process. This includes programming languages, databases, and other technologies that support the creation of software.

1. Use principle of seven phases of the SDLC to execute a campus-wide project for digitization of office documents
	   1. Identifying problems, opportunities, and objectives
	   2. Determining human information requirements
	   3. Analyzing system needs
	   4. Designing the recommended system
	   5. Developing and documenting software
	   6. Testing and maintaining the system
	   7. Implementing and evaluating the system

1. Company XYZ is a new Information Technology Service Oriented outfit which needs to determine the Human Information Requirements (HIR) needed for its proposed cutting-edge product. In order for this company to achieve its aim, XYZ needs to carry out series of activities to garner needed HIR. Briefly explain these HIR activities
	a. **User Interviews:** Conduct interviews with potential users to understand their information needs and preferences.
	b. **Surveys and Questionnaires:** Distribute surveys or questionnaires to collect data on user information requirements.
	c. **Observation:** Observe users in their work environment to identify the information they require in real-time.
	d. **Prototyping:** Create prototypes of the product and gather user feedback to refine and finalize information requirements.
	e. **Focus Groups:** Bring together representative groups of users to discuss and validate information needs collaboratively.
	
1. The dimension of modern challenges in ICT industries is making the roles of a system analyst becoming dynamic. Explain 5 roles of a system analyst
	- Consultant
	- Supporting expert
	- Agent of change
	- Requirement analyst
	- Facilitator of communication
1. Reasons for writing use cases
	a. **Understanding Requirements:** Use cases help in understanding and documenting system requirements from an end-user perspective.
	b. **Communication:** They serve as a communication tool between stakeholders, developers, and testers.
	c. **Testing:** Use cases provide a basis for creating test cases to ensure the system meets user expectations.
	d. **User Training:** Use cases can be used as a foundation for creating user manuals and training materials.
	e. **System Design:** They aid in the design process by identifying the interactions between users and the system.
1. Fountain university is constructing an ultra-modern clinic to cater for both staff and students of the institution, in an attempt to making this edifice meet the information age standard. Your company is approached to develop a hospital management system for the university clinic. 
	1. Make a list of business activities and use it to determine
		1. **External Activities:** - Patient Registration - Insurance Verification - Prescription Submission 2. **Data Flows:** - Patient Information - Insurance Details - Prescription Data 3. **Processes:** - Appointment Scheduling - Prescription Generation - Billing and Payments 4. **Data Stores:** - Patient Database - Insurance Records - Prescription History
	2. Create a context diagram that shows external entities and data flow to and from the system
		For the Hospital Management System at Fountain University Clinic, the context diagram should include the following elements:
		- **Main System:** Represented at the center of the diagram, indicating the Hospital Management System being developed.
		- **External Entities:**
		    - **Patients:** Represented as an external entity, as they interact with the system by registering, submitting prescriptions, and providing insurance details.
		    - **Insurance Companies:** Another external entity, reflecting the interaction for insurance verification and processing.
		    - **Staff:** If staff members interact with the system in any significant way, they should be included.
		- **Data Flows:**
		    - **Patient Information Flow:** Arrows representing the flow of patient information from registration to various processes within the system.
		    - **Insurance Details Flow:** Arrows indicating the flow of insurance-related data between the system and external entities.
		    - **Prescription Data Flow:** Representing the flow of prescription information.
		- **Processes:**
		    - **Appointment Scheduling:** A process box showing the scheduling activity.
		    - **Prescription Generation:** Another process box for generating prescriptions.
		    - **Billing and Payments:** A process box indicating the financial transactions within the system.
	1. Draw a Diagram 0, the next level. Show processes and data stores at this level.
			Diagram 0 is the next level of detail below the context diagram and elaborates on the processes and data stores identified in the context diagram. It should include:
		- **Processes:**
		    - For each process identified in the context diagram, expand with more detail. For instance, under "Appointment Scheduling," you might have subprocesses like "Check Availability," "Book Appointment," etc.
		    - Each process should be represented by a rectangular box with a concise label.
		- **Data Stores:**
		    - Expand on the data stores identified in the context diagram. For example, the "Patient Database" could have details like "Personal Information," "Appointment History," etc.
		    - Represent data stores with a rectangular box and label.
		- **Data Flows:**
		    - Specify the data flows between processes and data stores. For instance, the flow of data from "Patient Information" to "Appointment Scheduling" or from "Prescription Generation" to "Billing and Payments."
		    - Represent data flows with arrows connecting processes and data stores.
		The goal is to provide a more detailed view of the system's internal workings while maintaining a clear and concise representation. Use proper labeling and symbols to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.
