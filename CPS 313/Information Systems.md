Introduction:
System design is a crucial process involving the implementation and operation of an information system. This note aims to provide a clearer understanding of system design, emphasizing required knowledge, the description of the problem, essential and implementation models, and the transformation from analysis to implementation.

Required Knowledge:
To effectively engage in system design, individuals must possess knowledge related to the organization's objectives, structures, processes, information technology, opportunities, and constants.

Description of the Problem:
The system design process involves two essential models:

1. Essential Model:
   - Focus: Role of the analyst
   - Steps:
     a. Defining the problem
     b. Gathering requirements
     c. Developing a system and model

2. Implementation Model:
   - Focus: Role of the designer
   - Steps:
     a. Defining the problem
     b. Gathering requirements
     c. Developing a system and model

System Design Process:
The transformation of the analysis model into an implementable model enhances formality, reduces errors, improves communication, ensures accurate requirements gathering, generates documentation, and addresses the significant cost implications of fixing errors during the maintenance phase.

Understanding a System:
A system is a group of interrelated procedures within an identifiable boundary, working together for a common purpose in a business structure.

Role of a System Analyst:
Skills Required:
1. Analytical
2. Technical
3. Managerial

System Design Phases:
1. System Planning and Selection:
   - Analyze and align organizational and operational needs.
   - Identify and describe potential products.
   - Describe the system scope and provide a business case.

2. System Analysis:
   - Study the organization's current systems and processes.
   - Utilize UML for system modeling.
   - Goal: Describe what needs to be done.

3. System Design:
   - Translate alternative solutions into detailed, logical, and physical specifications.
   - Logical design is independent of hardware or software platforms.
   - Physical design includes specific programming language, database, and architecture.
   - Goal: Identify how the task will be accomplished.

System Implementation and Operation:
The information system is coded, tested, installed, and undergoes periodic corrections and enhancements to provide a fully operational system.

Types of Analysis and Design:
1. Structured Analysis and Design
2. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

Techniques:
1. Structured Analysis: Focuses on modifying system processing requirements.
   - Data to store and use.
   - Input and output.
   - How functions work together.
   - Utilizes DFD (Data Flow Diagrams) and ERD (Entities Relational Diagrams) for structured flow techniques.
