**Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**

- Phased approach to solving business problems.
- Unique user activities in each phase.
- Seven phases:
   1. Identifying problems, opportunities, and objectives
   2. Determining human information requirements
   3. Analyzing system needs
   4. Designing the recommended system
   5. Developing and documenting software
   6. Testing and maintaining the system
   7. Implementing and evaluating the system

**Incorporating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Considerations:**

- Growing demand for analysts incorporating HCI in development.
- Enhances system quality and work life through a human-centered approach.

**Identifying Problems, Opportunities, and Objectives:**

- **Activity:**
   - Interviewing user management
   - Summarizing knowledge
   - Estimating project scope
   - Documenting results
- **Output:**
   - Feasibility report for management decisions.

**Determining Human Information Requirements:**

- **Activity:**
   - Interviewing, sampling, questionnaires, observing
   - Prototyping
   - Understanding current system's who, what, where, when, how, and why.
- **Output:**
   - Understanding user work interactions.
   - Knowledge to improve the new system.
   - Business functions and complete information on people, goals, data, and procedures.

**Analyzing System Needs:**

- **Activity:**
   - Creating diagrams, completing data dictionaries
   - Analyzing decisions
   - Preparing system proposals
- **Output:**
   - Recommendations on necessary actions.

**Designing the Recommended System:**

- **Activity:**
   - Designing data entry procedures, human-computer interface, system controls, and databases/files.
- **Output:**
   - Model of the actual system.

**Developing and Documenting Software:**

- **Activity:**
   - Working with programmers to develop software.
   - Collaborating with users for effective documentation.
   - Coding and removing errors.
- **Output:**
   - Computer programs and system documentation.

**Testing and Maintaining the System:**

- **Activity:**
   - Testing the information system.
   - Performing system maintenance.
- **Output:**
   - Identified problems (if any), updated programs, and documentation.

**Implementing and Evaluating the System:**

- **Activity:**
   - Train users
   - Plan smooth conversion
   - Review and evaluate system
- **Output:**
   - Trained personnel
   - Installed system

**The Impact of Maintenance:**

- Maintenance for:
   - Removing software errors
   - Enhancing existing software

**Approaches to Structured Analysis and Design:**

- Traditional SDLC
- CASE system development life cycle
- Object oriented  


**Case Tools:**

- Productivity tools for systems analysts.
- Improve routine work through automated support.

**Reasons for Using Case Tools:**

- Increasing analyst productivity
- Improving analyst-user communication
- Integrating life cycle activities

**The Agile Approach:**

- Based on values, principles, and core practices.

**Agile Values:**

- Communication
- Simplicity
- Feedback
- Courage

**Four Agile Resources:**

- Adjusted for successful project completion:
   - Time
   - Cost
   - Quality
   - Scope

**Five Stages of Agile Development:**

1. Exploration
2. Planning
3. Iterations to the first release
4. Productionizing
5. Maintenance
---
**Object-Oriented (O-O) Systems Analysis and Design:**

- Alternate to structured SDLC.
- Facilitates rapid system development.
- Cycle of analysis, design, and implementation.
- Examines system objects.

**Unified Modeling Language (UML) Phases:**

1. Define use case model:
   - Use case diagram
   - Use case scenarios
2. Create UML diagrams
3. Develop class diagrams
4. Draw statechart diagrams
5. Modify UML diagrams
6. Develop and document the system

**Choosing a Method:**

- Choose SDLC, Agile, or Object-oriented methodologies.

**When to Use SDLC:**

- Systems developed and documented.
- Important to document each step.
- Upper-level management prefers SDLC.
- Adequate resources and time available.
- Communication of new system workings is crucial.

**When to Use Agile:**

- Project champion of agile methods.
- Quick development in a dynamic environment.
- Rescue situation with no time to analyze failure.
- Customer satisfaction with incremental improvements.
- Agreement with agile principles by executives and analysts.

**When to Use Object-Oriented:**

- Problems suit class modeling.
- Organization supports UML learning.
- Gradual addition of subsystems.
- Possibility of reusing software.
- Willingness to tackle difficult problems first.

---

**Open Source Software:**

- Alternative to traditional development.
- Free to distribute, share, and modify.
- Characterized as a philosophy.
- Examples: Linux, Apache, Mozilla Firefox.

**Four Types of Open Source Communities:**

- Ad hoc
- Standardized
- Organized
- Commercial

**Six Key Dimensions Differentiating Open Source Communities:**

- General structure
- Environment
- Goals
- Methods
- User community
- Licensing

**Reasons for Participating in Open Source Communities:**

- Rapidity in software development.
- Faster development by a committed group.
- Fosters creativity.
- Many good minds work on innovative applications.
- Potential to reduce development costs.
- Bolster self-image.
- Contribute something worthwhile.

**Open Source Contribution and Differentiation:**

- Reasons include cost, managing resources, and time to market.
- Analyst participation reasons:
   - Curiosity about software benefits
   - Achieve collective design
   - Incorporate open source design into proprietary products, processes, knowledge, and IT artifacts.
