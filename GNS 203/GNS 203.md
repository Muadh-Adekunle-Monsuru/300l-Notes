In addition, every subject must wish the country well. He must avoid those acts which are capable of bringing harm to the leaders and the nation. He must not collaborate with saboteurs, be ready to serve the country and above all he must be ready to pay the supreme sacrifice if necessary. More importantly, citizens owe leaders cooperation by paying taxes promptly and obeying rules always.
