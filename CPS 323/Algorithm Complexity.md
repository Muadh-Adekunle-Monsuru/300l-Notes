## **Algorithm**
A step-by-step list of instructions for solving a programming problem. Complexity refers to the degree to which a system or component has a design or implementation that is difficult to understand and verify.

### **Categories of Algorithms**
- **Search:** Used to search for an item in a data structure.
- **Sort:** Used to arrange items in a specific order.
- **Insert:** Used to add an item to a data structure.
- **Update:** Used to modify an existing item in a data structure.
- **Delete:** Used to remove an existing item from a data structure.

### **Characteristics of Algorithms**
1. **Unambiguous:** Each step and its inputs/outputs should be clear and lead to only one meaning.
2. **Input:** An algorithm must have one or more well-defined inputs.
3. **Output:** An algorithm must have one or more well-defined outputs.
4. **Finiteness:** An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
5. **Feasibility:** An algorithm should be achievable with the available resources.
6. **Independence:** An algorithm should provide step-by-step directions independent of any programming code.

## **Algorithm Analysis**
- **Prior Analysis:** This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm. Efficiency is measured assuming constant factors like processor speed have no effect on the implementation.
- **Posterior Analysis:** An empirical analysis of an algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using a specific programming language and executed on a target computer machine, collecting actual statistics like running time and required space.

### **Factors in Algorithm Analysis**
- **Time Factors**
- **Space Factors**

Suppose X is an algorithm, and M is the size of the input data. The time and space are the main factors determining the efficiency of X. The algorithm's complexity gives the running time and storage space required in terms of the input data size.

- **Time Complexity:** Measured by counting key operations such as comparisons in sorting algorithms.
- **Space Complexity:** Measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.
