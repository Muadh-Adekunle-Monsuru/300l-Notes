Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm is a method of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm by examining how its running time or space usage grows as the input size increases. It is useful for comparing different algorithms that solve the same problem, or for estimating the scalability of an algorithm.


The best-case scenario of an algorithm is the one where it performs the minimum amount of work possible for any input. For example, if we have a sorting algorithm that checks if the input array is already sorted and returns it immediately if so, then the best-case scenario is when the input array is already sorted, and the algorithm takes O(1) time.

The average-case scenario of an algorithm is the one where it performs a typical amount of work for any input. For example, if we have a sorting algorithm that uses a random pivot to partition the input array into two subarrays and recursively sorts them, then the average-case scenario is when the pivot divides the array into two roughly equal parts, and the algorithm takes O(n log n) time.

The worst-case scenario of an algorithm is the one where it performs the maximum amount of work possible for any input. For example, if we have a sorting algorithm that uses a random pivot to partition the input array into two subarrays and recursively sorts them, then the worst-case scenario is when the pivot is either the smallest or the largest element in the array, and the algorithm takes O(n^2) time.
